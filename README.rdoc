My progress on learning React.js on Rails.

I am using react-rails and coffeescript to experiment and learn how to build fast and intuitive front-end UI.

To learn React, I am making a simple to do list.

So far I have:
  - Built a button with clicked state to activate a render of a form on the home page.
